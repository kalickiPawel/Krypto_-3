# Cryptology laboratory exercises no. 03

The purpose of the laboratory exercises was study of issues related to security of implementation 
RSA signature algorithm and get acquainted with security models of digital signatures schemas.

> Exercise Language -> Python 3.7.7

Tasks included:
- implementation,
- carry out experiments associated with the most famous attacks,
- preparing analysis on the secure implementation of RSA.


First, configure the virtual environment with your chosen method.
An example is presented below:
```
>>> python3 -m venv venv
>>> source venv/bin/activate
```
Then is worth install the package manager update and the required packages:
```
>>> pip install --upgrade pip
>>> pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To run the program, use the command below:
```
>>> python main.py
```
This command runs the CLI program that allows you to perform experiments from this laboratory exercises.
